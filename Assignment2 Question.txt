1.Create three components: GameControl, Odd and Even
2.The GameControl component should have buttons to start and stop.
3.When starting the game,  an event(holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second(ref=setInterval)
4.The event should be listenable from outside the component
5.When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted(clearInterval(ref)
6.A odd number should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happenn for the even component(on even numbers)
7.Simply output odd-number or even- number in the two components
8.Style the element(eg:paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
